	* Fixed bug where the x coordinate would read wrong if the value
	went into field 30. Reading of ATOM records now faster and less
	error prone. Can handle situat ion with no spaces between numbers.
	I no longer convert '*' to primes in the atom names of riboses in
	nucleic acids. Release as version 1.3.1
	* Changes in pucker to reflect the above.

	* Rama was revamped, now using opag to generate code for 
	option parsing. Now accepts --chains option. The routine
	read_matrix_file is now part of the library.

	* Funny, I updated this exactly a year ago! I improved the 
	way libatom categorizes residues. The pucker program was
	given an overhall, and now compiles with g++. Pucker now accepts
	the --chains option, and uses an opag generated option parser.

	* I had to rename vector.h to mox_vector.h, because it was
	clashing with <vector.h>. This is a problem when using the library
	from C++. Version 1.2.1.

	* Add new program salign, to produce a structural alignment.
	Bump version to 1.2

2006-03-20  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@ghost.bioxray.dk>

	* Several changes in library. Header files now usable from C++.
	Output of chain classes modified.  Construction of chains changed,
	so residues do not need to be contiguous in the PDB
	file. Cofactors are often placed at the end of the PDB file but
	with the same chain Id.  This would cause an other chain of the
	same Id to be added, but now that residue is added to the end of
	the earlier chain.

	* pdb2odb now includes a --chains argument to select chains.
	This should be extended to other programs as well.

	* Moved header files back to lib.

2006-02-27  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@ghost.bioxray.dk>

	* misc/chaincat.c (main): Fixed file open.
	  lib/libatom: fixed output.
	
2006-02-24  Morten Kjeldgaard  <mok@ghost.bioxray.dk>

	* Added man file to qdalign. As well as whole bunch of 
	program changes.

2006-02-08  Morten  Kjeldgaard  <mok@homunculus.local>

	* Convert library routines to ansi C.

Wed Apr  5 12:59:27 1995  Morten Kjeldgaard  <morten@beast.kemi.aau.dk>

	* pucker.c (main): 	

	How to use a text block:

	{
	   char **t;
	   db = dbpointer(DB, "_residue_conf");
	   t = (char **) db2->data;
	}

	then the array can be referenced with t[i];
